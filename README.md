# ElonUncle  
AI Bot for Age of Empires 2 Â®Microsoft

## Instruction on How to Run the AI

You must have two files for a custom AI to show up on the list of oppenents. Both files must have the exact same name, the exception will be in their extensions. One must have ".ai" and other ".per", this is where the code goes.  
Most AI's however are designed to use the first ".per" file to load other ".per" file/s, which usually is easier to manage and Code. You dont want to code everything into one.

Copy-Paste your AI files into the game directory ie ".ai" and ".per"
```
.\Age2HD\resources\_common\ai
```

**The next two pictures are against the AI made by renouned Scripter Resonance22**  
I was able to win only 7 out of 10 matches, surprisingly ElonUncle actually performed really well against ResonanceBot 5-1c.

**For all those wondering why I didn't try with Hardest AI**  
The answer is simple, they cheat in between the games with the resources.
I need to match against Barbarian and other top level AI's; Also Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is already released, so I will shift onto DE.
